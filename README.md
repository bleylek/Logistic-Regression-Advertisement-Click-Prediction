Logistic Regression Advertisement Click Prediction

This repository hosts a data-driven project aimed at predicting user engagement with online advertisements. Using a logistic regression model, we explore a dataset of internet users' behaviors and characteristics to predict the likelihood of clicking on an advertisement. The project underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing targeted advertising strategies.

Project Overview:
In this project, we analyze a synthetic advertising dataset representing the features of internet users and their interactions with online ads. Our goal is to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a user will click on an ad based on their profile and online behavior.

Dataset Features:
The dataset includes the following attributes, providing a comprehensive view of each user's interaction with the website and ads:

- Daily Time Spent on Site: The amount of time (in minutes) the consumer spends on the site daily.
- Age: The age of the consumer in years.
- Area Income: The average income of the consumer's geographical area.
- Daily Internet Usage: The average amount of time (in minutes) the consumer spends on the internet daily.
- Ad Topic Line: The headline of the advertisement.
- City: The city of the consumer.
- Male: A binary indicator (1 if male, 0 if female) representing the consumer's gender.
- Country: The country of the consumer.
- Timestamp: The time at which the consumer either clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- Clicked on Ad: A binary outcome (1 for clicked, 0 for not clicked) indicating whether the ad was clicked.

Technologies Used:

This project leverages a range of technologies and libraries within the Python ecosystem for data processing, analysis, and machine learning. Below is a breakdown of the key technologies utilized:

- Python: The core programming language used for the entire project, chosen for its readability, simplicity, and extensive support for data science and machine learning libraries.

- Pandas: An open-source data manipulation and analysis library, used for handling and preprocessing the dataset. It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, utilized for performing operations on multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It provides support for a wide range of mathematical operations, which are essential for data analysis.

- Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy. It is used in this project for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It was used for making complex plots from data in pandas DataFrames more accessible.

- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python, used for building the logistic regression model. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's used for the development, documentation, and execution of the project code and analysis.
